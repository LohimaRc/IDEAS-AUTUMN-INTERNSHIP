This project focuses on predicting house prices using data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and regression modelling. A dataset containing information on housing attributes such as number of bedrooms, bathrooms, living area, basement area, grade of the house, and location-related features was analysed. To handle data quality issues, various imputation techniques were applied, including mean, standard deviation replacement, linear and polynomial interpolation, and K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) imputation on both raw and scaled data. Feature selection was carried out by examining correlations with the target variable, Price. Exploratory analysis was performed through statistical summaries, distribution plots, heatmaps, and pairwise feature distributions. The processed dataset was then split into training and testing subsets, and a linear regression model was trained to predict housing prices. Model performance was evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (RÂ²) metrics. The results indicate that proper handling of missing values and feature selection significantly improves prediction accuracy, providing valuable insights into the relationship between house attributes and pricing. This project demonstrates the importance of data preprocessing and statistical learning methods in solving real-world economic and housing market problems.
